Section 6
FIELDCRAFT AND TACTICS
General
1. Fieldcraft is an integral part of the Army Cadet Syllabus. It combines many of the 
skills that the cadet has learnt in a challenging but enjoyable activity. The subject also 
offers senior cadets an ideal scenario in which to practice and develop their leadership 
and administrative abilities.
2. Fieldcraft training is an excellent way of developing character and learning how to 
function as a member of a team. Individual skills must be of a high standard, but many 
objectives can only be achieved by working together as part of a team.
Organisation of Instruction
3. No specific qualification is required to instruct fieldcraft and tactics above and 
beyond those detailed at page 25.
4. Instructors are allowed flexibility in the method they adopt to teach the various 
lessons provided they do not deviate from the facts and drills laid down. Fieldcraft, 
properly presented is an interesting subject and presents a challenge to the cadet.
5. Fieldcraft is best taught by means of demonstrations (possibly films) explaining to 
the cadets what they are seeing and then confirming by practice as soon as possible.
6. Demonstrations must be carefully prepared and rehearsed whether they are on a 
big scale, or just the instructor showing his squad how to crawl. Poor demonstrations are 
of little value.
7. Practice periods can be repeated according to progress made.
8. Fieldcraft does not lend itself to 40-minute periods. Some lessons and practices 
need far longer, and others are best combined into a day and night exercise.
Organisation of Assessments 
9. Assessments must be properly structured within training to allow cadets the best 
possible chance of success.
10. This syllabus lists the formal assessments that cadets must pass to allow them to 
complete their Star grades, but assessment should be a continuous process throughout 
all training. The instructor should be assessing cadets during all basic lessons, practice 
periods, Battle Lessons and Battle Exercises to allow them to develop.
11. The syllabus is designed to give cadets enough training to allow them to pass the 
test, but the instructor must be flexible and allow more training for struggling cadets. It is 
detrimental to all to allow a cadet who is clearly not ready for assessment to be 
assessed.
12. The testing standards must be rigorously kept to for several reasons:
a. This syllabus is designed to be progressive and each section builds on 
previously learned knowledge and skills. A cadet who has been “paper passed” at 
one level will be unfairly prepared and will be naturally disadvantaged once they 
have progressed to the next level. If a cadet has not reached the required 
standards before progressing this may lead to dangerous practice at a higher level 
in training.
b. It is unfair for hard working cadets if everyone is “block passed” due to low 
standards or lack of integrity on the instructor’s part.
c. Any cadet who does not reach the required standard should receive 
remedial training before a retest.
Some assessments require several cadets to take part. If the required number of cadets 
are not available extra cadets or CFAV’s may be used if they are at the correct standard.
Specific Safety Precautions 
13. Fieldcraft training can present many hazards and therefore must be subjected to 
rigorous planning and preparation.
14. Before every lesson, all weapons, magazines and cadets’ pouches must be 
inspected to ensure that no unauthorised ammunition is present. 
15. Several mentions of “casualties” are made throughout the manual. In all these 
cases the drills covered only relate to simulated casualties as controlled by the Exercise 
Conducting Officer (ECO). Any real casualties are to be handled in accordance with the 
medical plan for the exercise. 
16. Blank ammunition and pyrotechnics. Whenever blank ammunition or 
pyrotechnics are being used in training all the rules and regulations in Cadet Training –
Ranges must be followed.

Basic – Fieldcraft and Tactics
Training
1. Introduction: Fieldcraft training is necessarily limited at basic training level:
a. Most Basic Training is conducted at detachment level meaning that there is 
limited, if any, training estate.
b. Some Basic Training Lessons will invariably be carried out before cadets 
have been issued their uniform, most Fieldcraft lessons will be of limited value if 
conducted without uniform.
c. For those lessons where ideally, rifles will be carried the cadet may either:
(1) Carry a GP Rifle if they have completed Rifle Lesson 1.
(2) Carry an appropriate training aid.
(3) Only learn those movements without the rifle being carried. In which 
case practice will be required the first-time rifles are issued.
2. Instructor qualification. Standard as per page 25.

11. Part 2 – Stalk:
a. Description:
(1) Cadets must move from an allocated start area into a predefined 
area construct a range card and then move to a finish point without being 
observed.
(2) Ground must be selected carefully to make the cadets goals 
achievable and also to test their selection of camouflage and methods of 
movement. The start and end locations must be obvious to the cadets and so

Section 8
EXPEDITION
General
1. Expeditions are a core element of the Army Cadet Syllabus and the Army Cadet 
experience. They enable cadets to experience self-sufficiency. Cadets will operate as 
teams and will apply the training they receive in other areas of the Syllabus, including 
elements of First Aid, Leadership, and Navigation. Delivery of the Expedition modules is 
through taught knowledge and skills Lessons. At Two, Three and Four Star, cadets will 
be assessed during unaccompanied, remotely supervised expeditions.7
2. This Expedition Syllabus for ACS21 has been updated to acknowledge the 
similarities between the Army Cadet Syllabus and the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, which 
cadets may choose to undertake. Integration of Syllabus and DofE expeditions will 
enable Units to efficiently deliver expeditions which satisfy the assessment requirements 
of both awards.

ADVENTUROUS TRAINING
General
1. Army Cadet Adventurous Training (AT) is unique, it influences the cadet’s 
personal development and inspires them to achieve their full potential. AT provides an 
opportunity to engage in arduous and challenging activities that significantly enhance the 
cadet’s ability to identify and manage risk, it develops teamwork, leadership and moral 
courage. But above all else, progressive, stimulating and safely managed AT is fun, 
provides an alternative learning environment and supports the recruiting and retention of 
personnel.

KEEPING ACTIVE
General
1. Keeping Active supports cadets in gaining the very best from the 'Cadet 
Experience'. Being active has both physical and mental benefits. It improves your fitness 
and makes you stronger. Physical exercise has a positive repercussion on leadership 
skills because it drives firm behaviours that support the Army Cadets Values and 
Standards. Equally, it increases stamina and the resilience that is naturally built into all 
activities within the Army Cadet Syllabus.

MUSIC – PIPING AND DRUMMING
General
1. The Army Cadets ACS Piping and Drumming Syllabus lays down the Policy for 
Pipes and Drums training within the Army Cadets. The Syllabus has been developed by 
the National Training Team for Army Cadet Pipes and Drums and is laid out in order as 
per the Scottish Qualifications Authority syllabi for piping and drumming which also 
follows the same. While the information is broadly based on the Royal Scottish Pipe 
Band (RSPBA) curriculum for the elementary course, further information has been 
included to ensure that it meets the requirements of the SQA Syllabi for both piping and 
drumming as well as the Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board (PDQB) syllabi for 
bass and tenor.
2. The syllabus, which is in part progressive, teaches music theory and practical 
lessons from a basic level, up to being able to take part in various parades, displays and 
concerts. It also mirrors the syllabus requirements for the Scottish Qualifications Authority 
(SQA) and Piping and Drumming Qualifications Board (PDQB), allowing the cadets to 
achieve external qualifications at the same time as completing Star qualifications.

11. Overall assessment policy. JCIC is not a pass or fail part of the syllabus, it is 
designed to give instructors a chance to identify which cadets will be good instructors at 
detachments and will benefit from attending SCIC. Completion of JCIC is required to 
complete 3-Star no matter the result.
12. Westminster recording. On successful completion the following qualification 
should be awarded “Junior Cadet Instructors Cadre”.
13. Suggested lessons. The below lessons are ideas of lessons that could be given 
to cadets. Others may be chosen as long as they are Basic or 1-Star, a subject the cadet 
is familiar with, an activity that does not require an additional qualification. Most lessons 
in the syllabus are longer than 15 min so some parts of them should be removed for the 
purpose of JCIC.
